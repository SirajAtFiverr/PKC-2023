# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# Vraiables means anything that can vary(change).

# Rules for naming variables:
# 1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# 2. A variable name cannot start with a number
# 3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# 4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# 5. Variable names cannot contain spaces
# 6. Variable names should not be python keywords
# 7. Variable names should be short and descriptive

# Examples of valid variable names:
# myvar = "John"
# my_var = "John"
# _my_var = "John"
# myVar = "John"
# MYVAR = "John"

# Example of invalid variable names:
# 2myvar = "John"
# my-var = "John"
# my var = "John"
# myvar@ = "John"

x = 5 # integer variable
y = 12.4 # float variable
z = "Hello World" # string variable
t = True # boolean variable

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
print(type(t))
